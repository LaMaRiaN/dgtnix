To compile the driver run './configure' then 'make'. It will install the lib and binairies in the default system directories. You can also set this directory, see './configure --help' and option --prefix.   

In this package are also present a 
	+ dgtnix.py : a python library loader/wrapper for dgtnix. 
	+ dgtnixTest.py : the same test/client program than dgtnixTest but written in python.
	+ dgtnixVirtualBoard.py : a virtual DGT board to test chess programs against the driver without a board connected.
	+ QtWidget : a directory containing the sources of QtWidget, a simple client program with a 3D view of the board. Need Qt>=4.1.

ALL USERS
---------

DRIVER :
--------

./configure --prefix="/usr/" 
make
make install


VIRTUAL BOARD :
---------------
The initial input of the dgtnix driver is a filename (as COM1 or /dev/ttyS0 for example). In the case of a virtual board, the file is created by dgtnixVirtualBoard. It's name is the first argument to dgtnixVirtualBoard and is set to be /tmp/dgtnixSock by default.
1)
dgtnixVirtualBoard.py 

then run a client application (as dgtnixTest.py for example)

C++ VERSION TEST
----------------
1) 
dgtnixTest <port>

where <port> is the port to which the board is connected.
For usb connection, try : /dev/usb/tts/0 /dev/usb/tts/1 /dev/usb/tts/2 ...
For serial, try : /dev/ttyS0 /dev/ttyS1 /dev/ttyS2 ...
For the virtual board, /tmp/dgtnixSock is the default but you can choose it ...

PYTHON VERSION TEST
-------------------
1) 
./dgtnixTest.py <port>

where <port> is the port to which the board is connected.
For usb connection, try : /dev/usb/tts/0 /dev/usb/tts/1 /dev/usb/tts/2 ...
For serial, try : /dev/ttyS0 /dev/ttyS1 /dev/ttyS2 ...
For the virtual board, /tmp/dgtnixSock is the default but you can choose it ...

QtWidget
-----------
There is a Qt4.1 application in the directory QtWidget. You
can build if you have qt4.1 installed on your system :

1) compile 
cd QtWidget
qmake 
make

2) run the application
./QtWidget



Warning: The Mac OSX and Cygwin version are for testing only !
 

The automake/autoconf/libtool scripts where build unsing :

automake 1.9
aclocal 1.9
autoconf 2.6

to recreate them use :
autoreconf --install --force
